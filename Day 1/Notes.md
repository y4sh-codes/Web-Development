# Web Development Basics

## 1. What is Web?
The **Web (World Wide Web)** is a system of interconnected documents, applications, and media accessible through the internet using web browsers.  
It allows users to view, share, and interact with information and services via websites and web applications.

## 2. Difference Between Website and Web Application

| Feature            | Website                                    | Web Application                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Provides static information                | Provides interactive functionality (dynamic information)             |
| Example            | News site, portfolio                       | Gmail, Facebook, Online Banking                |
| User Interaction   | Limited (mostly viewing)                   | High (users can input, interact, and get output) |
| Technology         | Basic HTML, CSS, JS                        | Advanced frameworks, databases, APIs           |
| Complexity         | Usually simpler                            | More complex, often requires authentication    |

## 3. What is Full Stack Web Development?
**Full Stack Web Development** is the practice of building both the **front-end (client-side)** and **back-end (server-side)** of a web application, including database management.

### Components of Full Stack:
1. **Front-end (Client-side):**
   - What the user sees and interacts with.
   - Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and frameworks like **React, Angular, Vue**.

2. **Back-end (Server-side):**
   - Handles logic, business rules, and communication with the database.
   - Built using **Node.js, Django, Flask, Express.js**, etc.

3. **Database:**
   - Stores application data.
   - Examples: **MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL**.

4. **Version Control:**
   - Manages code history and collaboration.
   - Example: **Git & GitHub**.

5. **Deployment/Hosting:**
   - Makes the application available online.
   - Examples: **Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Heroku**.

## 4. What is MERN Stack?
The **MERN Stack** is a popular set of technologies for full stack web development.  
It includes:

- **M**ongoDB â†’ NoSQL database for storing data.  
- **E**xpress.js â†’ Back-end framework for Node.js to handle APIs and server logic.  
- **R**eact â†’ Front-end library for building user interfaces.  
- **N**ode.js â†’ JavaScript runtime for running server-side code.  

ðŸ‘‰ MERN allows developers to build **end-to-end applications** using only JavaScript.
